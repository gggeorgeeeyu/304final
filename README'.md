# Data
The data I used for study and research is collected by VCycene.Inc. The data is a survey that aims to figure out the best features of their composter that customer likes. All the data I obtained are not cleaned and needs to be further manipulated.

# Overview of Paper
In the paper, we discussed, analyzed and visualized the distribution of the data set pulled out from the survey. We inspected the methodology of the survey and then conducted an analysis of the best features based on different segmentation of the respondents. Alongside, the weakness of the survey and the next steps are provided in the paper for future improvement of the survey. We attatched the reference at the very end.
